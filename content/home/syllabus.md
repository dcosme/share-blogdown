## Code of conduct
The instructor is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate in this seminar. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the seminar at the discretion of the instructor.

### Expectations
It is my expectation that event participants will not engage in harassment of any kind, including:

* Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion.
* Sexual images in public spaces
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Harassing photography or recording
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Unwelcome or inappropriate physical contact
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. The instructor is also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, they should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. We expect participants to follow these rules in all seminar-related activities.

### Consequences
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the instructor retain the right to take any actions to keep the seminar a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender, expulsion from the seminar and/or not being allowed to participate in future seminars. The instructor may take action to redress anything that disrupts the seminar or makes the environment hostile for any participants.

### If you experience or witness any violationsâ€¦
Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of this seminar for everyone. We want you to be happy during this seminar. People who speak up make this seminar a better place. If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it to the instructor as soon as possible.
