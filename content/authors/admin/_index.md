This is the website for an 8-week pro-seminar for University of Pennsylvania students involved with [Penn Leads the Vote](https://www.pennvotes.org/) to get hands on experience conducting applied research and analyzing data in the context of their ongoing PLTV activities.

This seminar will be held Spring 2021.
